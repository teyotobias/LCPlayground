    "Description: Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It works similarly to how you might sort playing cards in your hands.\n",
    "The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part.\n",
    "Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.\n",

    "If the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before. Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element."
